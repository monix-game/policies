## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information to provide and improve the Service:

### 1.1 Personal Information

- **Account Information**: When you register or log in, we collect your username and a hashed version of your password. If you enable two-factor authentication (2FA), we may also collect your email address or phone number for verification purposes.
- **Profile Information**: You may optionally provide additional details such as a profile picture, bio, or cosmetic preferences, which may be visible to other users.
- **Transaction Data**: When you engage in activities like trading resources, we collect details about these transactions, including item IDs, currency amounts, and timestamps.
- **Communication Data**: Messages you send in chat rooms, including private rooms, are collected, including content, timestamps, and your username.

### 1.2 Automatically Collected Information

- **Device and Usage Data**: We collect information about your device, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and usage patterns (e.g., pages visited, time spent on features).
- **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**: We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, track usage, and improve the Service. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.
- **Log Data**: Our servers log actions such as login attempts, item creation, and chat activity for security and moderation purposes.

### 1.3 Information from Third Parties

- **Authentication Services**: If you link your Monix account to third-party services, we may receive limited information about your account on that third-party service.
- **Payment Processors**: If you purchase virtual currency, subscriptions, or virtual items, payment processors may provide us with transaction confirmation details (though we do not store full payment information).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service, including:

- **Account Management**: To create and manage your account, authenticate logins, and secure your profile with features like 2FA.
- **Service Delivery**: To enable trading, chatting, fishing, pet management, and other interactive features.
- **Communication**: To send you notifications (e.g., about trades or bans), respond to inquiries, and moderate chat rooms.
- **Security and Fraud Prevention**: To detect and prevent cheating, spam, or abuse, using IP addresses, logs, and automated moderation tools.
- **Analytics and Improvement**: To analyze usage trends, improve features (e.g., trading dynamics), and develop new content.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. However, we may share it in these cases:

- **With Other Users**: Your username, profile details, chat messages, and transaction history (e.g., resources sold) may be visible to other users as part of the Service.
- **Service Providers**: We share data with third-party providers (e.g., hosting services) to operate the Service. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements.
- **Moderation and Support**: Moderators and administrators may access your data (e.g., chat logs, IP addresses) to enforce rules or investigate reports.
- **Legal Obligations**: We may disclose information to comply with laws, respond to subpoenas, or protect our rights and the safety of others.
- **Business Transfers**: If Monix is involved in a merger or acquisition, your information may be transferred to the new entity.
- **Public Platforms**: Links to our GitHub repository, but we do not share your data with these platforms unless you choose to engage with them separately.

## 4. Data Protection and Security

We prioritize the security of your information and implement the following measures:

- **Encryption**: We use encryption to protect data during transmission and storage (e.g., password hashing, secure API calls).
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA adds an extra layer of account security using time-based codes.
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized personnel (e.g., admininstrators) can access sensitive data, and access is logged.
- **AutoMod**: Automated systems monitor for spam, fraud, and abuse, blocking suspicious IPs or accounts.
- **Regular Updates**: We perform ongoing security audits and updates to address vulnerabilities.

Despite these efforts, no online service is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access.

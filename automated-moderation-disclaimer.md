Automated moderation tracks specific actions that could violate rules or disrupt the community. Below is what it watches for and how it responds:

### 1. Multiple Account Creations

- **What it detects:** Attempts to create multiple accounts from the same IP address in a short time frame, which may indicate efforts to bypass rules or spam the system.
- **What AutoMod does:** Temporarily blocks the IP address from creating new accounts and notifies moderators for review.

### 2. Message Spam

- **What it detects:** Excessive message posting in a short period, which can disrupt conversations.
- **What AutoMod does:** Temporarily mutes the user to stop further spam, with longer mutes possible for newer accounts.

### 3. Failed Login Attempts

- **What it detects:** Repeated unsuccessful login attempts from the same IP address, potentially signaling an attempt to access someone else’s account.
- **What AutoMod does:** Temporarily locks the IP address out of the login system to enhance security.

### 5. Suspicious Behavior
